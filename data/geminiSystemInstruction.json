Look for ones in the city center or near the waterfront.\n\nThis is a very basic suggestion. To make it more useful, please tell me:\n\n1. What kind of hotel are you looking for (budget, mid-range, luxury)?\n2. What kind of seafood restaurant are you hoping for (e.g., casual, upscale, specific type of seafood)?\n3.
